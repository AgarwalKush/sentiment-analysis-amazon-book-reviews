# How To Execute
	
	-> Highlight everything and run. (should output SVM graph and accuracy, then Naive Bayes graph and accuracy, and then Wordcloud.  Final results printed at the end)
	
	**Please note** : if you get an error about setting the correct working directory, here is how you can fix it:
	In RStudio, in the menu bar all the way on top click Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory.  A browsing dialog box opens up - choose the folder "group2files" from the flash drive or wherever it has been extracted.  This should clear the error.
